# TotalPollBot
Welcome to my TotalPoll bot.  This project is not intended to be used with
malicious intentions and is only a simple reverse engineering of a popular
WordPress plugin.  Keep in mind that the only reason this works is because
TotalPoll uses cookies to keep track of users that already voted.  However,
the plugin does offer the ability to block users by IP address after they
have voted once already.  I take no responsibility for nefarious usage of
this bot as it only created for educational purposes.

This project is an adaptation on the previous bot that was created. This
bot utilizes tor-request in order to randomize the IP of the vote. This
bot therefore bypasses the TotalPoll option to block duplicate votes
from the same IP. This bot, however, operates at a slower pace than the
other one and cannot have multiple instances ran simultaneously. This bot
has been created for educational purposes only and I take no responsibility
for nerfarious usage of this bot. -Dlee99 (Dwlee99)
